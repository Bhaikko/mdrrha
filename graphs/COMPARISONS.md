## Test Cases Bar Graph
### It plots
* Average Turnaround Time
* Average Waiting Time
* Context Switches
_On Same Graph_

## Algos comparison in Experiments Bar Graphs
### each metric (ATAT, AWT, ART) having its own bar graph
### Algos Considered
* RR 
* SJF
* Round Robin
* DRRHA
* mDRRHA
* nDRRHA with SJF

## Algos considered in Experiments Line graphs 
### each metric (ATAT, AWT, ART) having its own line graph
### Algos Considered
* RR
* SJF
* DRRHA
* mDRRHA
* nDRRHA with SJF without Equation
* HRRNHA with normal distribution without Equation

## Direct Comparison on Bar Graph
* nDRRHA with SJF
* HRRNHA with normal distribution

## Datasets Considered
* 4 test Cases From DRRHA
* NDRRHA and HRRNA on smaller dataset mentioned in paper
* Kaggle 1(500) for Experiment 1 and non zero case only
* Random Data both AT Z and AT NZ case

## Additional Notes
* One Time Execution for Algo for a case number

* add RR to line graphs
* 40 for TQ RR

* Test cases - Bar Graphs Only
* Experiments - Bar and Line
